This theory says that the endometrial stem cells which shed into the uterus during the menstrual cycle can migrate out of the uterus through retrograde menstruation, seed there and establish endometriotic lesions. But why was endometriosis was seen in only 10% of women despite the presence of retrograde menstruation in more than 90% of them? There is a lot of evidence shows that the stem cells which generate endometriotic lesions are different from normal ones. They have a higher ability to proliferation and a lower capacity for differentiation and decidualization
